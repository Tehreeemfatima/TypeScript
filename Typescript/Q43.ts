//Q#43: Unchanged Magicians: Start with your work from Exercise 40. Call the
// function make_great() with a copy of the array of magicians’ names. Because the
// original array will be unchanged, return the new array and store it in a separate array.
// Call show_magicians() with each array to show that you have one array of the original
// names and one array with the Great added to each magician’s name.
